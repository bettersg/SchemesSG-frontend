        Schemes SG started as a side project by our product lead. A long-time volunteer, he collated a "help-list" to facilitate referral work and built a front-end to share these resources. The tool gained unexpected traction with social workers and volunteers. Sensing that this could address care workers' pain point of navigating the confusing social assistance landscape, he gathered like-minded individuals from the
        <a href="https://better.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> better.sg </a>
        tech community to improve the tool.
        <br />
        <br />
        The team engaged social workers, caregivers and friends to understand lived experiences and help-seeking practices. They found that social needs are often intertwined, and if technology could improve the search process by making sense of the entangled issues that people face, it would immensely reduce help-seekers' mental burden. This inspired our natural language tool and indexing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Schemes SG is ultimately built for the community, with the community. Your continued usage, feedback, searches and contribution of crowdsourced assistance info help this tool get better everyday.

        Serious thought was put in before building Schemes SG. Our landscape scans helped us realise that:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Social assistance information was often piecemeal and fragmented across various sites. There were some compilations, but they were often PDF files hidden within the repositories of organisations' websites, and were hard to find. Search engines might also miss them.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Even if one could get their hands on a compilation, it would take painstaking "Ctrl + F" excavation to find schemes, given how complex social assistance is. The volume of information was simply mind-boggling.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. The listings might not necessarily be updated. New versions were usually held in completely different links. PDF listings also meant that social workers and volunteers depended on the original compiler to issue a new version when things changed.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. There were intuitive directories (e.g. SupportGoWhere has done a great job), but they were primarily government portals and might not include NGO or VWO schemes. Again, the power of the crowdsourcing could be useful here, given the size of the non-profit sector.
        <br />
        <br />
        This portal hopes to address the above issues by tapping on the power of
        the crowd to make social assistance info
        {' '}
        <strong>1) comprehensive</strong>
        {' '}
        and
        {' '}
        <strong>2) updated</strong>
        , and
        then using technologies like AI/NLP and filters in data visualisation to
        make this info
        {' '}
        <strong>3) navigable.</strong>

        :
        <br />
        <br />
        1. All information is
        {' '}
        <strong>public-domain</strong>
        . Schemes SG only
        agglomerates info that is out there to help navigate complexity. Where
        individual schemes are concerned, we think the best descriptions come
        from the organisations themselves and use their writeups wherever
        possible to avoid misrepresenting their good work :) If we make edits,
        it is to improve search functionality, and we ensure they are minor and
        factually accurate.
        {' '}
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Currently, Schemes SG only lists schemes that
        {' '}
        <strong>provide benefits</strong>
        {' '}
        in cash (financial assistance,
        subsidies) or in kind (free food, food vouchers, free clinics, special
        cards which ascribe certain benefits). While
        {' '}
        <strong>services</strong>
        (e.g. subsidised special education) are not yet included, we may start
        to look into it in the near future once the team has more capacity.
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>Schemes SG does not include</u>
        :
        <br />
        <br />
        1.
        <strong> Auto-inclusion schemes</strong>
        . The purpose of a
        consolidated public aid portal is to help reduce bandwidth tax, so we
        see no need to put in extra information that social workers and
        volunteers have no requirement to act on.
        <br />
        <br />
        2.
        <strong>
          {' '}
          Schemes that do not have a public listing, or are not verified
        </strong>
        . We understand that sometimes, organisations may have reasons for
        keeping their social assistance informal. Hence, if there is no public
        info on it, we will not include it. If the info is crowdsourced, we ask
        the contributor for a link, and if there is none, we will contact the
        organisation or even the private individual to verify first.

        . As the user base grows, we get more Schemes Bank contributions and
        Schemes Pal queries, allowing us to train more robust and accurate
        semantic matches. Schemes Case requests cover the blind spots from a
        domain perspective and act as sanity checks on the model. The three
        components work in tandem to create an ever-improving, ever more robust
        Schemes SG.
